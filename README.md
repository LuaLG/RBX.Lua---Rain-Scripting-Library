# RBX.Lua---Rain-Scripting-Library
A general-purpose RBX.Lua scritping library, consisting of functions by many Rain members.

Each Rain member contributes in their own module. Each contributing module can be found in the modules directory. If you're a Rain member and you'd like to contribute, speak to me (Autumn) and I'll set you up.

All individual modules in the final ROBLOX upload (including Documentation.lua) will be parented to core/MainModule. MainModule is responsible for loading each module's contents and serving it to the user in a single package.

The current core scripts are placeholders for some very cool coolness later. You will see, it's really cool.
